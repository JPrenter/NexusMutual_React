# How Nexus Mutual's Claims Process Works

One of the most critical aspects of any insurance system is how claims are handled. At Nexus Mutual, we've built a transparent, community-driven process that has achieved a 100% payout rate for valid claims while maintaining the integrity of our mutual.

## The Four-Step Claims Process

### Step 1: Review and Submit
When an incident occurs, the first step is to review whether your situation is covered by your plan's wording. Each cover product has specific terms that define what types of losses are covered.

**What you need to do:**
- Check if your incident matches the cover product wording
- Gather initial documentation
- Submit your claim through our dashboard

### Step 2: Provide Incident Details
Once you've submitted your claim, you'll need to provide comprehensive details about what happened.

**Required information includes:**
- Timeline of events
- Affected protocols and amounts
- Transaction hashes and wallet addresses
- Any relevant communications or announcements

### Step 3: Submit Proof of Loss
Different cover products require different types of proof. This is where you demonstrate the actual financial impact.

**Typical proof requirements:**
- **Protocol Cover**: Evidence of funds in affected protocol at time of incident
- **Slashing Cover**: Proof of validator penalties
- **Depeg Cover**: Evidence of stablecoin holdings during depeg event

### Step 4: Community Assessment
This is where Nexus Mutual's unique approach shines. Our community of Claims Assessors reviews each claim and votes on its validity.

**Assessment process:**
- Claims Assessors review all submitted evidence
- Discussion occurs in dedicated Discord channels
- Voting period lasts 72 hours
- Decisions are made within 3-6 days typically

## What Makes Our Process Special

### Community-Driven Decisions
Unlike traditional insurance companies with centralized claims departments, Nexus Mutual relies on community expertise:

- **Diverse perspectives**: Assessors come from various DeFi backgrounds
- **Technical expertise**: Many assessors are developers, researchers, or experienced DeFi users
- **Aligned incentives**: Assessors stake NXM tokens and are rewarded for honest voting

### Transparent and Open
Everything about our claims process is transparent:

- **Public discussions**: Claims are discussed openly (with privacy protections)
- **On-chain voting**: All votes are recorded on the blockchain
- **Public outcomes**: Results and reasoning are shared with the community
- **Historical data**: Past claims and outcomes are publicly available

### Proven Track Record
Our numbers speak for themselves:

- **$18+ million in claims paid** since inception
- **100% of valid claims compensated**
- **Average 3-6 day payout** time
- **Over 50 successful claims** processed

## Case Studies: Claims in Action

### Rari Capital Fuse Markets ($5M Paid)
**The Incident**: In April 2022, a vulnerability in Rari Capital's Fuse lending markets led to an $80M exploit.

**Our Response**:
- Claims submitted within hours of the incident
- Community quickly confirmed the exploit details
- Technical analysis verified affected users
- $5M in claims paid within 3 days

**Member Feedback**: *"Getting my claim approved was a huge silver lining for me. Much love."* - Jamsqueeze

### CREAM Finance Exploit ($397K Paid)
**The Incident**: CREAM Finance suffered a $130M exploit in October 2021 due to a flash loan attack.

## Behind the Scenes: How Assessors Work

### Staking and Incentives
Claims Assessors must stake NXM tokens to participate:

- **Skin in the game**: Assessors risk their own capital
- **Rewards for honesty**: Correct votes earn additional NXM
- **Penalties for fraud**: Malicious voting can result in token burning

### Technical Analysis
Our assessors bring deep technical expertise:

- **Smart contract analysis**: Understanding exploit vectors
- **Transaction forensics**: Tracking funds and identifying victims
- **Protocol expertise**: Knowledge of specific DeFi protocols

### Community Discussion
Before voting, assessors engage in thorough discussion:

- **Evidence review**: All submitted documentation is examined
- **Technical debate**: Complex cases are discussed in detail
- **Precedent setting**: Past decisions inform current assessments

## What This Means for You

### Fast Payouts
Our streamlined process means you get compensated quickly:

- **No lengthy bureaucracy**: Community decisions are rapid
- **Technical expertise**: Assessors understand DeFi incidents
- **Incentivized speed**: Faster decisions benefit everyone

### Fair Outcomes
The community-driven approach ensures fairness:

- **Multiple perspectives**: No single entity controls decisions
- **Transparent reasoning**: All decisions are explained publicly
- **Appeals process**: Disputed decisions can be reviewed

### Continuous Improvement
We learn from every claim:

- **Process refinements**: Each case improves our procedures
- **Cover improvements**: Claims inform product development
- **Community growth**: More experience leads to better decisions

## Preparing for a Potential Claim

### Document Everything
Keep records of your DeFi activities:

- **Screenshots**: Capture important interface states
- **Transaction records**: Save all relevant transaction hashes
- **Communication**: Keep records of protocol announcements

### Understand Your Coverage
Know what your plan covers:

- **Read the wording**: Understand the specific terms
- **Ask questions**: Engage with our community if unclear
- **Stay updated**: Cover terms may evolve over time

### Act Quickly
If an incident occurs:

- **File promptly**: Submit claims as soon as possible
